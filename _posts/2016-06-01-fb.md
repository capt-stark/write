The other day, I read an [article](https://backchannel.com/instagram-is-ruining-vacation-701086a67440?token=O0Y5FECEQlIMw53q#.4zwbne57l) by [Mary Pilon](http://marypilon.com/), author of a book called _The Monopolists_. The article was called 'Instagram Is Ruining Vacation'. Mary uses her Instragram snapshot of a temple in Cambodia (the one I'd seen in Tomb Raider ) to illustrate how people are more interested in capturing perfect pictures of their travels than in enjoying the travelling experience itself.
