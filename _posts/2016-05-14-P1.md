<p style="margin:60px">
What would the dead want from us <br>
Watching from their cave?<br>
Would they have us forever howling?<br>
Would they have us rave<br>
Or disfigure ourselves, or be strangled<br>
Like some ancient emperor's slave? <br><br>
None of my dead friends were emperors<br>
With such exorbitant tastes<br>
And none of them were so vengeful<br>
As to have all their friends waste<br>
Waste quiet away in sorrow<br>
Disfigured and defaced.<br><br>
I think the dead would want us<br>
To weep for what they have lost.<br>
I think that our luck in continuing<br>
Is what would affect them most.<br>
But time would find them generous<br>
And less self-engrossed. <br><br>
And time would find them generous<br>
As they used to be<br>
And what else would they want from us<br>
But an honoured place in our memory,<br>
A favourite room, a hallowed chair,<br>
Privilege and celebrity?<br>
And so the dead might cease to grieve<br>
And we might make amends<br>
And there might be a pact between<br>
Dead friends and living friends.<br>
What our dead friends would want from us<br>
Would be such living friends. <br><br>
<sup>James Fenton</sup>
