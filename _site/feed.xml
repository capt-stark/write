        <title>A New Bunch Of Letters</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I write letters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple, hand-written letters, three-folded and put into yellow envelopes to be given to people. I do that because spoken words are hurried and perishable and are lost in the wind, while written words can be treasured and carry a quaint silence of their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And sometimes, I write letters to myself. And since I spend more time at the keyboard and the screen than with a pen and a book these days, I would like to keep these letters stashed away in A Yellow Envelope - a space for my words, which is, funnily,  neither yellow nor an envelope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &quot;Writing is easy. All you have to do is cross out the wrong words.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;
