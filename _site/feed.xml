        <title>The Facebook Dilemma</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The other day, I read an &lt;a href=&quot;https://backchannel.com/instagram-is-ruining-vacation-701086a67440?token=O0Y5FECEQlIMw53q#.4zwbne57l&quot;&gt;article&lt;/a&gt; by &lt;a href=&quot;http://marypilon.com/&quot;&gt;Mary Pilon&lt;/a&gt;, author of a book called &lt;em&gt;The Monopolists&lt;/em&gt;. The article was called ‘Instagram Is Ruining Vacation’. Mary uses her Instragram snapshot of a temple in Cambodia (the one I’d seen in Tomb Raider ) to illustrate how people are more interested in capturing perfect pictures of their travels than in enjoying the travelling experience itself.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>What would the dead want from us?</title>
        <description>What would the dead want from us

Watching from their cave?

Would they have us forever howling?

Would they have us rave

Or disfigure ourselves, or be strangled

Like some ancient emperor&#39;s slave?


None of my dead friends were emperors

With such exorbitant tastes

And none of them were so vengeful

As to have all their friends waste

Waste quiet away in sorrow

Disfigured and defaced.


I think the dead would want us

To weep for what they have lost.

I think that our luck in continuing

Is what would affect them most.

But time would find them generous

And less self-engrossed.


And time would find them generous

As they used to be

And what else would they want from us

But an honoured place in our memory,

A favourite room, a hallowed chair,

Privilege and celebrity?

And so the dead might cease to grieve

And we might make amends

And there might be a pact between

Dead friends and living friends.

What our dead friends would want from us

Would be such living friends.

        <title>A New Bunch Of Letters</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Sometimes, I write letters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Simple, hand-written letters, three-folded and put into yellow envelopes to be given to people. I do that because spoken words are hurried and perishable and are lost in the wind, while written words can be treasured and carry a quaint silence of their own.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And sometimes, I write letters to myself. And since I spend more time at the keyboard and the screen than with a pen and a book these days, I would like to keep these letters stashed away in A Yellow Envelope - a space for my words, which is, funnily,  neither yellow nor an envelope.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;
    &quot;Writing is easy. All you have to do is cross out the wrong words.&quot;
  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
